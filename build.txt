If you want to build your own executable on Windows, it's pretty straightforward :
- Install your Python 3.8 or 3.9 environment
- Launch python prompt
- Install pyinstaller with this command : `pip install pyinstaller`
- Depending on your environment you might need to install `pip install requests`
- Get latest commits through git (git pull)
- Copy all `.py` files and the `arduboyicon.ico` file in a work directory
- Go into the work directory and type : `pyinstaller --icon=arduboyicon.ico --clean -F main.py`
- Your exe will be generated into a `dist` subDirectory
- Just copy README.md, arduboyicon.ico, build.txt and conf, and gui directories alongside the main exe and you're good to go
